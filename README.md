# Create animated bubble map of Confucius Institutes in R like a pro

Read and implement these lines of code to make a superb animated bubble map in R

In my co-authored [article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09668136.2020.1785397) we analyze 530 Confucius Institutes at universities and
colleges and 631 Confucius Classrooms in primary and secondary schools outside China to find that the institutes generated a backlash because China has disproportionately placed them at prestigious universities in democratic countries that do not share China's political or cultural values.

In this repo, I'll walk you through the process of creating an animated bubble map of Confucius institutes over time so that you can get a better sense of their expansion across the globe.
